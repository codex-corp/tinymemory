    // major bump and not a minor one, and the reason is the whole point of the
    // rule: negotiation is family-granular, so a driver advertising `Tree` at
    // (3, 0) would be bound and then asked for a method it has never heard of.
    // The major half is what refuses that bind instead of discovering it at
    // the call.
    //
    // (3, 0) was the same shape one round earlier: `count_chunks`, the three
    // entity-occurrence members and the two tree-forest members, all onto
    // already-advertised families.
    //
    // Note for anyone reading the history: #85/#86/#89/#90 also added methods
    // to advertised families and stayed on the minor half, and so did #122 —
    // the first round of the openhuman engine shed, which put `Summarise`,
    // `RootSummaries`, `ChunkScore`, `DegradedState` and `SourceIngestStatus`
    // onto existing families and shipped as v1.13.5 without touching this
    // constant. All of that was wrong by this rule; those releases and their
    // hosts moved in lockstep so nothing was bound across the gap, but it is
    // drift, not precedent. This round declines to extend it.
    //
    // (4, 1): the five granular operation capabilities are new families, so
    // capability negotiation makes their addition minor-safe.
    // (4, 2): optional coding-session diagnostics and checkpoint progress.
